# DSFC_XAI_workshop

Welcome to this repository, featuring the methods and techniques I cover in the workshop [Hands-on Explainable ML](https://dsfc.nl/sessions/hands-on-explainable-ml-ai/)


Refer to the **requirements** file to see which libraries you need to be able to reproduce this code. 

I avise you to either create a virtual environment in ***pip*** or ***conda*** and install the needed packaged there. If you need some help in creating a virtual environment in pip, refer to the **Setting up a Pip virtual enviornment** document. 

Alternatively, you can download and run the notebook in Google CoLab, which is also what I will be doing during the session. Note however that using CoLab requires a couple of additional steps (such as mounting the drive)- but do not worry, these steps are clearly defined in the code.

### What we will cover in the workshop?

In the hands-on part of the workshop, we will:
- Train a less transparent model on a sklearn data set
- Use a more complex transparent model (RuleFit)
- Visual explanations: Accumulated local effects (ALE)
- Feature importances when we do not have a tree-based models
- Local explanations: Shapley values
- Cool applications: Shapash
