I advise you to set up a virtual environment in Python, to make sure some of the packages we
will download (see list below) will not interfere with other packages you may have in your base environment.

Here is how to do that. Please feel free to Google this as well. I am showing how to do that for a pip environment, you may prefer to work with a conda environment as well.

  1. Install the virtualenv package (where the --user is not always required but you may need it depending on the permission you have)
    ***pip install --user virtualenv***

  2. Create the virtual environment
  ***virtualenv my_environment***

  3. Activate the virtual environment
    1. Mac/Linux
    ***source my_environment/bin/activate***
    2. Windows
    ***my_environment\Scripts\activate***

  4. Deactivate
  ***deactivate***

  5. To be able to run Jupyter notebook or Lab, you need to install ipykernel on your virtual environment. Make sure you have activated and are working in your virtual environment. Again, --user is not always required.
  ***pip install --user ipykernel***

  6. Next, you can add your virtual environment to Jupyter by:
  ***python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my_environment***

Again, you may not need to --user
Next step is activate your virtual environment and start jupyter notebook or jupyter lab.
